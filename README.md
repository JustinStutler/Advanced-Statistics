### About me
### Hello all. I am Justin Stutler. I previoiusly studied Computer Science and played esports at Kennesaw State University. I have worked some in web development and enjoyed the challenges, but I am more interested in working in the Data Science field. After the creation of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, how could I not be interested in pursuing data?
### Outside of school, I enjoy yoga, cooking, board games, video games, anime, documentaries, learning, and meeting new people.

### About me
### I previoiusly studied Computer Science and played esports at Kennesaw State University. I have worked some in web development and enjoyed the challenges, but my interests are more alligned with data science. I have come back to school to learn more and prepare myself for that line of work.
### Outside of school, I enjoy yoga, cooking, board games, video games, anime, documentaries, learning, and meeting new people.

### About me
### Hello all. I am Justin Stutler. I previoiusly studied Computer Science and played esports at Kennesaw State University. I have worked some in web development and enjoyed the challenges, but I am more interested in working in the Data Science field. After the creation of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, how could I not be interested in pursuing data?
### Outside of school, I enjoy yoga, cooking, board games, video games, anime, documentaries, learning, and meeting new people.

### First R Studio Assignment LIS 4372
``` 
1 assignment = c(6,18,14,22,27,17,22,20,22)
2 myMean = function(assignment) {
3 return(sum(assignment)/length(assignment))
4 }
5 myMean(assignment)
```
### So, what happens in the code above?
```
1: we created a container "assignment" that holds the data values of 6,18,14,22,27,17,22,20,22
2-4: we created a function "myMean" that returns the mean of a given container
5: we called "myMean" with a parameter of (assignment) which returned 18.66667 as the mean of assignment
```
